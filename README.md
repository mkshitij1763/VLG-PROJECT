# VLG-PROJECT
The Zero-DCE model is applied and evaluated in this project to improve low-light photos. A revolutionary method called Zero-DCE, or Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation, uses deep learning to improve picture quality without the need for paired or unpaired training data. TensorFlow and Keras were used in the model's implementation, which was trained on the given dataset. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and a number of bespoke loss functions were used to assess the model's performance. The outcomes showed that low-light photos' visual quality had significantly improved.
